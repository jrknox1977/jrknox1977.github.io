# Intro
This is the oldest of the VulnNet boxes on Try Hack Me. It is also rated as a medium difficulty box.

## Recon
First we will scan the host. I will use [autorecon](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon) by [Tib3rius](https://twitter.com/0xTib3rius) to get things started. 

If you have never used it before and would like some explaination, check out this post: [Using AutoRecon](https://knox.technology/posts/using_autorecon/)
